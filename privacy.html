<h1>Full Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
This Privacy Statement addresses SmartyPAL Inc’s (“SmartyPAL,” “our,” “us,” “we”) practices regarding information collected from users who download and register one or more of our mobile applications (“Application” or “Applications”). This Privacy Statement only addresses information collected directly through or from our Applications – it does not address or govern any information gathering, use, or dissemination practices related to information collected from the user (sometimes referred to as “you” or “your”) other than directly through or from our Applications, such as from telephone, facsimile, postal mail, personal delivery, or other or additional offline means or media. This Privacy Statement is incorporated into our Terms and Conditions by reference, as if set forth fully therein, which must be reviewed and accepted by you. By using our Applications, you consent our collection and use of your information as follows:
Collection of Information from Users & Use of Information Collected
SmartyPAL collects information from users who voluntarily submit such information in order to download, register, and use our Applications. When you register with us and use our Applications, you generally provide: (a) your name, email address, child’s age, child’s gender, and password; (b) information you share with us when you contact us for assistance; and/or (c) transaction-related information, such as when you make purchases, respond to any offers, or download or use Applications from us. Registration is optional; however, you will not be able to use some of the features offered by our Application unless you register with us. For example, many of the adaptive and personalized features will be limited.
Information that we collect may be used by us for many reasons, for example, for marketing and promotional purposes, recordkeeping, processing online orders, product development, content improvement, and statistical analysis of users’ behavior. Your financial information submitted to us for purchases may be maintained and housed by us for the purpose of processing payments and conducting related transactions. We may use the information you provide to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.
In addition, the Application may collect certain information automatically, such as the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device’s unique device ID, your mobile device’s IP address, your mobile operating system, the type of mobile Internet browser(s) you use, information about the way a user uses the Application, and learning data that we collect when a user uses the Application. 
We may also use Internet “cookies” to recognize users who have visited us before in order to improve their experience. We may also log information from your browser or mobile device, including your IP address, location, and cookie information. We use your location information to provide requested location services and to offer specific recommendations and relevant information based on your location. You may at any time opt out from further allowing us to access your location data by managing your location services in the setting section of your mobile device or by contacting us at privacy@smartypal.com.
</p>
<h4>Collection and Use of Children’s Information</h4>
<p>We understand the need to provide extra security and caution with information relating to children. Children’s information will be used only in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Statement. We limit our collection of personal information from children to no more than what is reasonably necessary to use our Applications or those applications of our third party partners. We do not use our Applications to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.
Download and registration of our Applications is not intended for children under the age of 13. If you provide personally identifiable information about a child under the age of 13, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of such child or have the full legal right to provide such information and consent to the collection of such information provided about your child. We will not knowingly collect personally identifiable information directly from children under the age of 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personally identifiable information without your consent, you should contact us at privacy@smartypal.com. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
</p>

<h4>Disclosure of Information to Third Parties</h4>
<p>
We will share your information with third parties only in the ways that are described in this Privacy Statement. We may disclose information collected from users:
a.     as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, court order, or other form of legal process;
b.    when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
c.     to our trusted service providers who work on our behalf and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this Privacy Statement; or
d.    if SmartyPAL enters or reasonably may enter into a corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, in which case you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our website (<www.smartypal.com>) of any change in ownership or uses of this information as well as any choices you may have regarding this information.
We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how the Application is being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or promotional use. If you would like to opt out from third party use of this type of information to help serve targeted advertising, please see the section below entitled “Opting Out.”
</p>
<h4>Opting Out</h4>
<p>Except as necessary to obtain the products, services, or information requested, you may opt out of having your personal information prospectively retained by us, used by us for secondary purposes, or disclosed by us to third parties by contacting us at privacy@smartypal.com. We will retain your personal information for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you would like us to delete personal information that you have provided via the Application, please contact us at privacy@smartypal.com, and we will respond in a reasonable time. Please note that some or all of the personal information may be required in order for the Application to function properly, and we may be required to retain certain information by law. You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling the Application. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.
</p>

<h4>Access to and Ability to Correct Personal Information</h4>
<p>Upon your request via email to privacy@smartypal.com, we will provide you with a summary of any personal information retained by us that has been voluntarily provided by you. You may modify, correct, change, or update your personal information by contacting us via email at privacy@smartypal.com.  
</p>
<h4>
Security</h4>
<p>
We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that are designed to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
</p>
<h4>Right to Change Privacy Statement</h4>
<p>
This Privacy Statement may be updated from time to time for any reason. Usually updates will be due to new technologies, industry practices, or updated regulations. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Statement by posting the revised Privacy Statement here and as applicable sending it via email. You are advised to consult this Privacy Statement regularly for any changes. Your continued use of our Application indicates your consent to the revised Privacy Statement.
</p>
<h4>Your Consent</h4>
<p>By using the Services, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Statement now and as amended by us. "Processing” means using cookies on a computer or handheld device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining, and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the United States. If you reside outside the United States, your information will be transferred to the United States and processed and stored in the United States under U.S. privacy standards. By using the Application and providing information to us, you consent to such transfer to, and processing in, the United States.
